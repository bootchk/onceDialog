About
-----

A OnceDialog displays a text once over the life of an app's installation, 
if the user accepts the dialog.  
Otherwise (if you call it when an app starts, and the user rejects it) 
it displays again the next time a user starts your app.

Typically used for a license.

Not a splash screen (which displays AS an app prepares to start.)


License
-------

LGPLv3+


Requirements
------------

Qt
Python
PySide (or PyQt)


Features
--------

The package includes an example app that uses OnceDialog.
It illustrates how to setup QSettings and call a OnceDialog.

The OnceDialog uses (depends on) templated text, easy to customize.

The default templated text is a simple license for the following situation:
- your app is proprietary but free of charge
- single use license
- your app is built using LGPL libraries which you must convey
  (for example, Python, Qt, PySide, and others.)
